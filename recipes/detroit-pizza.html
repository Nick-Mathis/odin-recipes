        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Gather all ingredients</li>
            
            <li>Pour <strong>1 cup warm water</strong> into the bowl of stand mixer; mix in <strong> 1 packet of yeast, 
                1 teaspoon sugar,</strong> and let dissolve.</strong> </li>
            
                <li>Add <strong>2 teaspoons olive oil, 1 teaspoon salt, 2 1/2 cups bread flour</strong>. Knead mixture together
            with a dough hook attachment until dough is very smooth, soft and elastic.</li>
            
            <li>Drizzle remaining <strong>1 teaspoon olive oil</strong> onto a 10x14-inch Detroit-style pizza pan; use your
            fingers to spread olive oil over the bottom of the pan. Place dough in the center of the pan. Oil your fingers, 
            then pull and stretch dough into a rectangular shape.</li>
            
            <li>Cover and let rise until doubled in volume, about <strong>1 hour</strong></li>
            
            <li>While dough is rising, make the sauce: Bring <strong>1 jar marinara sauce, 2 teaspoons oregano, 1 teaspoon
